# revealjs-pages
Test repo for publishing revealjs slides to github pages.

This repo takes the unusual approach to include revealjs as a git submodule instead of copying all the files.

Interestingly, after enabling GH pages on the repo it works out of the box since [submodules are pulled automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-submodules-with-github-pages).
